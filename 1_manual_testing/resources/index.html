        <h2>Introduction to Manual Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Manual testing is a fundamental aspect of software quality assurance where test cases are executed
            manually by a tester without using any automation tools. This approach allows testers to identify
            bugs, usability issues, and ensure that the software meets the specified requirements. Manual testing
            is particularly valuable for exploratory testing, ad-hoc testing, and scenarios where human observation
            and judgment are crucial.
        </p>

        <p>
            As you progress on your journey from QA to SDET, understanding manual testing principles provides
            a solid foundation. It helps you think critically about test scenarios, user experience, and edge
            cases that might not be immediately obvious when writing automated tests. The skills developed through
            manual testing—such as attention to detail, systematic thinking, and understanding user perspectives—are
            invaluable throughout your testing career.

        <h2>Key Topics Covered</h2>
        <p>
            This manual testing module covers essential concepts including test case design, bug reporting,
            test planning, and various testing methodologies such as functional testing, regression testing,
            and exploratory testing. You'll learn how to create comprehensive test cases, document defects
            effectively, and understand the software development lifecycle from a testing perspective.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through practical exercises and real-world examples, you'll develop the analytical skills needed
            to identify potential issues in software applications. These resources will guide you through
            best practices in manual testing and prepare you for the transition to test automation and
            software development in testing.
