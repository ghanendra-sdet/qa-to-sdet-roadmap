    <section>
        <h2>Introduction to Manual Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Manual testing is a fundamental aspect of software quality assurance where test cases are executed
            manually by a tester without using any automation tools. This approach allows testers to identify
            bugs, usability issues, and ensure that the software meets the specified requirements. Manual testing
            is particularly valuable for exploratory testing, ad-hoc testing, and scenarios where human observation
            and judgment are crucial.
        </p>

        <p>
            As you progress on your journey from QA to SDET, understanding manual testing principles provides
            a solid foundation. It helps you think critically about test scenarios, user experience, and edge
            cases that might not be immediately obvious when writing automated tests. The skills developed through
            manual testing—such as attention to detail, systematic thinking, and understanding user perspectives—are
            invaluable throughout your testing career.

        <p>
            This manual testing module covers essential concepts including test case design, bug reporting,
            test planning, and various testing methodologies such as functional testing, regression testing,
            and exploratory testing. You'll learn how to create comprehensive test cases, document defects
            effectively, and understand the software development lifecycle from a testing perspective.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through practical exercises and real-world examples, you'll develop the analytical skills needed
            to identify potential issues in software applications. These resources will guide you through
            best practices in manual testing and prepare you for the transition to test automation and
            software development in testing.

        <h2>Testing Best Practices</h2>
        <p>
            Effective manual testing requires a systematic approach and adherence to industry best practices.
            Start by thoroughly understanding the application requirements and user stories before designing test
            cases. Create clear, concise, and reproducible test cases that cover both positive and negative
            scenarios. Always document your testing process and maintain detailed records of test execution results.
        </p>

        <p>
            Communication is key in manual testing. When you discover a bug, ensure your bug reports are detailed
            with clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, severity classification, and supporting
            evidence like screenshots or logs. Collaborate closely with developers and stakeholders to understand
            the context of issues and verify fixes promptly. Remember that quality is everyone's responsibility,
            and your insights as a tester are valuable throughout the development lifecycle.
        </p>

        <h2>Essential Tools and Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            While manual testing doesn't rely on automation tools, various software tools can enhance your
            efficiency and effectiveness. Bug tracking systems like Jira, Bugzilla, or Azure DevOps help manage
            defects systematically. Test management tools such as TestRail or Zephyr assist in organizing test
            cases and tracking execution progress. Browser developer tools are invaluable for inspecting elements,
            monitoring network requests, and debugging issues during testing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond tools, mastering testing techniques is crucial. Exploratory testing allows you to investigate
            the application creatively without predefined scripts. Boundary value analysis helps identify edge
            cases where defects often hide. Equivalence partitioning reduces the number of test cases while
            maintaining coverage. Understanding these techniques will make you a more effective tester and better
            prepare you for writing automated tests in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Manual Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding different types of manual testing is crucial for comprehensive quality assurance. Functional
            testing verifies that each feature of the software operates according to specifications. Integration testing
            ensures that different modules or services work together correctly. Smoke testing provides a quick check
            to determine if the build is stable enough for more rigorous testing. Regression testing confirms that new
            code changes haven't adversely affected existing functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            User Acceptance Testing (UAT) involves end-users validating the software meets their business requirements
            and is ready for production. Exploratory testing is a creative, simultaneous learning, test design, and
            execution approach where testers explore the application to discover unexpected behaviors. Usability testing
            evaluates how user-friendly and intuitive the application is. Each testing type serves a specific purpose,
            and mastering when and how to apply them makes you a versatile and effective tester.
        </p>

        <h2>Career Growth Path</h2>
        <p>
            Starting as a manual tester is an excellent entry point into the software testing field. As you gain
            experience, you'll develop deeper insights into software behavior, common defect patterns, and quality
            attributes. This foundation is essential before transitioning to automation and SDET roles. Many
            successful SDETs attribute their effectiveness to their strong manual testing background, which helps
            them design better automation strategies and write more meaningful test scripts.
        </p>

        <p>
            The journey from QA to SDET involves continuous learning and skill development. While manual testing
            teaches you what to test and why, automation teaches you how to test efficiently at scale. Focus on
            building programming fundamentals, understanding test automation frameworks, and learning about
            continuous integration and delivery practices. Combine your testing expertise with technical skills,
            and you'll be well-positioned for a rewarding career as a Software Development Engineer in Test.
