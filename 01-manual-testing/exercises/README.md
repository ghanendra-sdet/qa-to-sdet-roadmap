## 📚 Exercises

## 1️⃣ Test Scenario Writing

### 🎯 Objective
Practice identifying **high-level test scenarios** based on requirements.

### 📖 What is a Test Scenario?

A test scenario is a **high-level description of what to test**, without detailed steps. It answers "**What to test?**" not "**How to test?**"

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad: "Enter email and password, click login"
- ✅ Good: "Verify login functionality with valid credentials"

---

### ✍️ Exercise 1.1: Login Feature Scenarios

**Requirement:**
```
Users should be able to log in using email and password. 
After 3 failed attempts, the account should be locked for 15 minutes.
```

**Your Task:** Write test scenarios covering:
- ✅ Positive scenarios
- ❌ Negative scenarios
- 🔢 Boundary conditions
- 🔒 Security considerations
- 🎨 Usability checks

### 💡 Sample Scenarios:

| Scenario ID | Test Scenario | Category |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| TS-001 | Verify login with valid credentials | Positive |
| TS-002 | Verify error message for invalid password | Negative |
| TS-003 | Verify account lock after 3 failed attempts | Security |
| TS-004 | Verify account unlocks after 15 minutes | Security |
| TS-005 | Verify login behavior when fields are left blank | Negative |
| TS-006 | Verify password masking in password field | Security |
| TS-007 | Verify "Remember Me" functionality | Functional |
| TS-008 | Verify "Forgot Password" link navigation | Functional |
| TS-009 | Verify login with SQL injection attempt | Security |
| TS-010 | Verify login response time under load | Performance |

---

### ✍️ Exercise 1.2: E-commerce Cart Scenarios

**Requirement:**
```
Users can add/remove items from cart. Cart persists across sessions.
Max 10 items per product. Free shipping over $50.
```

**Your Task:** Write 10-12 test scenarios covering:
- Adding items
- Removing items
- Quantity limits
- Session persistence
- Free shipping calculation
- Edge cases

> [!TIP]
> Think about what could go wrong: negative quantities, special characters in inputs, session timeout scenarios.

---

## 2️⃣ Test Case Design

### 🎯 Objective
Convert test scenarios into **detailed, executable test cases**.

### 📖 Test Scenario vs Test Case

| Aspect | Test Scenario | Test Case |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Level** | High-level | Detailed |
| **Focus** | What to test | How to test |
| **Steps** | Not included | Step-by-step |
| **Data** | Generic | Specific |
| **Example** | "Verify login functionality" | "1. Enter email: test@example.com 2. Enter password: Test@123..." |

---

| P1 | age < 18 | Invalid | 17, 10, 5 |
| P2 | 18 ≤ age ≤ 60 | Valid | 25, 40, 55 |
| P3 | age > 60 | Invalid | 61, 80, 100 |

**Step 2:** Write Test Cases

```markdown
TC-EP-001: Enter age = 17 (P1 - Invalid)
Expected: Error message "Age must be between 18 and 60"

TC-EP-002: Enter age = 30 (P2 - Valid)
Expected: Age accepted

TC-EP-003: Enter age = 70 (P3 - Invalid)
Expected: Error message "Age must be between 18 and 60"
```

---

### ✍️ Exercise 3.1.2: Discount Code Validation

**Requirement:**
```
Discount codes:
- "SAVE10" - 10% off

1. Identify equivalence partitions
2. Write test cases for each partition
3. Consider case sensitivity (SAVE10 vs save10)

---

### 3.2 Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

### 📖 Concept
Test at the **boundaries** of equivalence partitions, where defects are most likely.

**For range [min, max], test:**
- min - 1 (just below)
- min (boundary)
- min + 1 (just above)
- max - 1 (just below)
- max (boundary)
- max + 1 (just above)

---

### ✍️ Exercise 3.2.1: Password Length Validation

**Requirement:** Password length must be `8–16` characters

**Boundary Values:**

| Test Case | Input Length | Value | Expected Result |
|-----------|--------------|-------|-----------------|
| TC-BVA-001 | 7 chars | Test@12 | ❌ Error: Min 8 chars |
| TC-BVA-002 | 8 chars | Test@123 | ✅ Valid |
| TC-BVA-003 | 9 chars | Test@1234 | ✅ Valid |
| TC-BVA-004 | 15 chars | Test@1234567890 | ✅ Valid |
| TC-BVA-005 | 16 chars | Test@12345678901 | ✅ Valid |

-----------|--------|--------|--------|----
Condition 1| T/F    | T/F    | T/F    |
Condition 2| T/F    | T/F    | T/F    |
-----------|--------|--------|--------|----
Action 1   | X      |        | X      |
Action 2   |        | X      |        |
```

---

### ✍️ Exercise 3.3.1: Loan Approval System

| **Actions** |
| Approve Loan | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reject Loan | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Test Cases:**

```markdown
TC-DT-001 (R1): Income=$60K, Credit=750
Expected: Loan Approved

TC-DT-002 (R2): Income=$60K, Credit=650
Expected: Loan Rejected - "Insufficient credit score"

TC-DT-003 (R3): Income=$40K, Credit=750
Expected: Loan Rejected - "Insufficient income"

TC-DT-004 (R4): Income=$40K, Credit=650
Expected: Loan Rejected - "Does not meet criteria"
```

---

### ✍️ Exercise 3.3.2: Shipping Cost Calculator

- ✔️ **Document everything** - Keep a learning journal
- ✔️ **Test real applications** - Use demo sites or open-source projects
- ✔️ **Review your work** - Self-critique improves quality
- ✔️ **Learn from failures** - Each bug found is a learning opportunity
- ✔️ **Ask questions** - "Why does this happen?" deepens understanding
- ✔️ **Build a test portfolio** - Showcase your work to employers

### ❌ DON'T:

- ✖️ **Rush through exercises** - Quality over quantity
- ✖️ **Skip documentation** - Writing solidifies learning
- ✖️ **Test only happy paths** - Edge cases reveal true understanding
- ✖️ **Ignore context** - Every application has unique requirements
- ✖️ **Work in isolation** - Join QA communities, share learnings

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Writing vague test scenarios | Cannot derive specific test cases | Use action verbs: "Verify", "Validate", "Check" |
| Skipping preconditions | Tests fail due to setup issues | Always document setup requirements |
| Not testing negative scenarios | Misses majority of real-world bugs | For every positive test, write 2-3 negative tests |
| Copying test cases blindly | Doesn't build understanding | Write from scratch, then compare with examples |
| Ignoring environment details | Bugs become irreproducible | Always document OS, browser, versions |
| Testing without requirements | Missing acceptance criteria | Seek clarification before testing |
